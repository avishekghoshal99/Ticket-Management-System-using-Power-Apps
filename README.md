Overview:

This project focuses on creating a Ticket Management System using Microsoft Power Apps. The system is designed to streamline the process of tracking, managing, and resolving support tickets within an organization. It provides an intuitive interface for users to submit, monitor, and manage tickets, while allowing support teams to efficiently prioritize and resolve issues. The solution is built to enhance productivity, improve response times, and provide better visibility into the status of support requests.

Features:

Ticket Tracking: Real-time updates on ticket status, with the ability to track the progress of individual tickets from submission to resolution.
Priority Management: Automated prioritization of tickets based on urgency and impact, ensuring that critical issues are addressed first.
Role-Based Access: Different access levels for users, support agents, and administrators, allowing for appropriate permissions and controls.
Notifications: Automated email and in-app notifications to alert users and support staff of ticket updates, assignments, and resolutions.
Reporting and Analytics: Dashboards and reports to provide insights into ticket volumes, resolution times, and team performance.

Tools and Technologies:

Power Apps: Primary platform used for building the ticket management application.
